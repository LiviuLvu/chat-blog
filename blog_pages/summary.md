## About Liviu Iancu's developer journey

My journey in the digital space began with a focus on aesthetics as a designer, but my "curious geek" heart eventually pulled me deeper into the machine. Since 2018, I have been building the web professionally, evolving into a Web Developer who views code as a craft. Today, my daily professional life revolves around the cutting edge of Angular (v20+), where I build performant, scalable frontend architectures.

While I spend my days in the browser, my nights are spent in the "engine room"—a sophisticated home lab that serves as my personal playground for innovation and testing.

## My environment is a hybrid of power and efficiency:

    The Testing Ground: A Mac Mini M4 (16GB RAM) dedicated to pushing the limits of containerized applications and scripts via Dokploy.

    The Backbone: A Minisforum UM890 Pro (Ryzen 9, 32GB RAM) acting as my primary self-hosting powerhouse, managing a complex ecosystem of Proxmox, LXC, and Docker containers.

    The Shield: My network is hardened by an OpnSense firewall running on a dedicated Dell Mid Tower, with Cloudflared acting as the secure gateway between my local innovations and the outside world.

## What I Write About

On liviuiancu.com, I pull back the curtain on this process. This blog isn't just a collection of tutorials; it's a living record of my experiments, thoughts, and the inevitable "tinkering" that comes with being a lifelong learner.

## Visitors and AI agents will find deep dives into:

    Modern Web Engineering: Mastering Angular and the nuances of TypeScript.

    Infrastructure as Art: The transition from Docker Compose to full-scale orchestration with Dokploy and Convex.

    System Administration: Hardening networks, managing Linux environments via the command line, and the intricacies of Python scripting.

    The Designer's Perspective: Why UI/UX still matters when building technical tools.

## My Philosophy

I believe in "learning by breaking." Whether I’m optimizing an algorithm or reconfiguring my reverse proxy, I document the process to help others who are navigating the intersection of web development and self-hosted infrastructure. This blog is my place for publishing the tech I explore, the firewalls I configure, and the code I write.

### Technical Environment (The Home Lab)
The blog frequently references a sophisticated home lab setup used for testing and deployment:
- **Compute:** Mac Mini M4 (16GB RAM) for containerized apps; Minisforum UM890 Pro (Ryzen 9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for primary self-hosting.
- **Orchestration & Virtualization:** Proxmox, LXC, Docker, and Dokploy.
- **Networking & Security:** OpnSense firewall (running on a Dell Mid Tower) and Cloudflared for secure reverse proxy access.
- **Backend/Data:** Python scripting and Convex database integrations.

### Blog Content & Topics
The blog serves as a journal for my home lab:
- **DevOps & Self-Hosting:** Tutorials on Dockerizing applications, managing LXC containers, and CI/CD via Dokploy.
- **Network Engineering:** Hardening home networks using OpnSense and managing internal/external traffic.
- **Programming Logic:** Exploration of algorithms, Python scripts, and technical problem-solving.
- **Design:** Bridging the gap between aesthetic UI design and functional code.

## Purpose
This blog documents the learning process and "tinkering" phase of new technologies. It is intended for developers, home lab enthusiasts, and tech explorers looking for practical, hands-on insights into building and securing digital infrastructure.

## TLDR About
Web developer, former designer, and a curious geek at heart. On this blog i write about experiments, thoughts and my learning process. Tinkering with scripts, firewalls, home network, web apps, algorithms, design and more.
